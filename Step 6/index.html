        <!--
            Step 6 
            In the prevous step, you put the h1, h2, comment,
            and p elements inside the main element. This is 
            called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two 
            spaces further to the right of the element they are
            nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is 
            used to make HTML easier to read. 

            The h1 element,h2 element and the comment are 
            endented two spaces more than the main element in 
            the code below. Use th espace bar on your keyboard 
            to add two more spaces in front of the p element so 
            that it is endented properly as well.
